# Cloudup Plugin for Claude Code

Upload images to Cloudup directly from Claude Code, paying per upload with x402 micropayments. Agents can capture screenshots (e.g. via Playwright) and embed shareable URLs in PR comments, issues, and chat replies.

## What's in the plugin

- **MCP server** (`cloudup`) — wraps `tellyworth/mpp-remote` pointed at Cloudup staging
- **Skill** (`uploading-to-cloudup`) — teaches the agent when to reach for the upload tool
- **Slash commands** — `/cloudup <path>` for uploads, `/cloudup-setup` for one-time key provisioning

## Setup

### 1. Install the plugin

In a Claude Code session:

```
/plugin marketplace add StevenDufresne/cloudup-plugin
/plugin install cloudup@cloudup-plugin
```

### 2. Provision a wallet

Four paths; `/cloudup-setup` walks you through A, B, or D interactively. C is the build-agent escape hatch.

#### Path A — Privy agent wallet (recommended)

The plugin asks Privy's agent-wallet service to sign each x402 payment. The signing key lives in Privy; your machine only holds a per-user authorization keypair in the OS keychain (managed by the Privy CLI itself).

Install the CLI once:

```
npm i -g @privy-io/agent-wallet-cli
```

Then run `/cloudup-setup` in Claude Code, pick **Privy agent wallet**, and it walks you through `paw login` (browser-based) and prints the Ethereum address of your new wallet.

#### Path B — Locally generated key (macOS, laptop)

A fresh secp256k1 key generated on your machine and stored in the macOS Keychain. You hold the key — no third-party custody, but also no recovery if the laptop is lost. macOS only today.

Run `/cloudup-setup` in Claude Code and pick **Locally generated key**. It runs `scripts/cloudup-key.sh generate`, which generates the key, stores it under Keychain service `cloudup` / account `wallet`, and prints the derived address to fund. Manage the stored key with the same script:

```
scripts/cloudup-key.sh status     # is a key stored?
scripts/cloudup-key.sh address    # print the wallet address
scripts/cloudup-key.sh remove     # delete the key from Keychain
scripts/cloudup-key.sh set        # import an existing key (interactive paste, see Path D)
```

The script has no `show` subcommand by design — printing a raw private key from a CLI is a great way to leak it into shell history, scrollback, or (worst case) a Claude Code transcript that gets sent off-box. If you really need the raw key (e.g. to copy to another laptop), call the Keychain directly: `security find-generic-password -s cloudup -a wallet -w`.

#### Path D — Bring your own key (macOS, laptop, shared/exported key)

Use this when you already have a private key you want to use — typically a team-shared test wallet that someone has funded centrally, or a key you exported from another laptop. The key lives in the macOS Keychain alongside the Path B key (same slot), so the wrapper and management subcommands treat both identically.

Run `/cloudup-setup` in Claude Code and pick **Bring your own key**. It tells you to open a separate terminal and run:

```
scripts/cloudup-key.sh set
```

With no argument, `set` delegates to the macOS Keychain helper (`security add-generic-password ... -U -w`), which prompts silently for the key on the TTY. You paste your 0x-prefixed private key, hit Enter, and it's stored under service `cloudup` / account `wallet`. The key never enters argv (so it won't show in `ps`), shell history, the Claude transcript, or any log file.

`cloudup-key.sh set` refuses to run without a TTY — so attempting to invoke it from Claude's bash tool (`! …`) errors out by design. Always run it in a regular terminal window.

Programmatic callers that already have the key in memory (CI scripts, tests) can still pass it as an argument: `cloudup-key.sh set 0xabc…`. That accepts brief argv exposure as the caller's trade-off and is not appropriate for interactive paste.

#### Path C — `CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` env var (CI, headless, TeamCity)

Paths A and B both require interactive setup that doesn't work on a build agent: `paw login` is browser-based, and macOS Keychain doesn't exist. For headless contexts, set:

```
export CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY=0x...   # a fresh secp256k1 key you generated
```

The wrapper skips Privy and Keychain entirely and signs locally with viem. Keep the funded balance thin (each upload ≤ `CLOUDUP_MAX_USD`); a leaked key drains exactly what you funded.

**Signer precedence in the wrapper:** if `CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` is set it wins (CI path). Otherwise a Keychain-stored key wins if present (Path B or D — same slot, indistinguishable to the wrapper). Otherwise the wrapper falls back to `paw` (Path A). Switching between Keychain-based paths and A on the same machine requires removing the previous one's state first — `scripts/cloudup-key.sh remove` to drop the Keychain key, or clear the paw session.

### 3. Fund the wallet with USDC

Send testnet USDC to your wallet address on **Base Sepolia** (chain ID 84532). A small amount is plenty — each upload costs ~$0.05. The Cloudup server submits the meta-transaction on your behalf, so you don't need ETH for gas.

For Path A, `paw fund` opens Privy's funding flow in a browser. For Paths B and C, use a Base Sepolia faucet:

- [Circle USDC faucet](https://faucet.circle.com/) — primary (USDC-only is sufficient)
- [Coinbase CDP faucet](https://portal.cdp.coinbase.com/products/faucet) — fallback (ETH + USDC)

### 4. Optional configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `CLOUDUP_MAX_USD` | `0.20` | Spending cap per upload — refuses to sign above this. Default covers the large-file `begin_upload` SKU (~$0.20); raise if you'll upload bigger payloads. |
| `CLOUDUP_MCP_URL` | `https://api.stage-cloudup.com/mcp/public` | Server endpoint (swap for prod when available) |
| `CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` | _(unset)_ | Path C selector. If set to a `0x…` private key, skip both `paw` and Keychain and sign locally with viem. Use for CI / headless agents only. |
| `CLOUDUP_PROXY` | _(unset)_ | Outbound proxy passed to mpp-remote as `--proxy <value>`. Leave unset for external users. A8c users on the staging endpoint set this to `socks5h://127.0.0.1:8080` (the conventional `ssh -D 8080 <bastion>` forwarder). See "Reaching the staging endpoint" below. |

### 5. Remove any duplicate manual cloudup MCP

If you previously registered an `mpp-remote`-backed Cloudup MCP server manually (e.g. via `claude mcp add`), remove it. Claude Code silently suppresses plugin-declared MCP servers whose command + args match an existing manually-configured one, so the plugin's `cloudup` will appear to "do nothing" if a manual duplicate exists.

```
claude mcp list                                # find any manual cloudup-* entries
claude mcp remove <your-cloudup-server-name>
```

### 6. Restart Claude Code and verify

Start a fresh Claude Code session. Run `/mcp` and confirm `cloudup` shows as connected. Then test:

```
/cloudup /tmp/screenshot.png
```

Or let the agent reach for it naturally: ask it to take a Playwright screenshot of any URL and embed the result in a draft PR comment. The skill will trigger and the URL will appear in markdown.

## How it works

When the agent calls the upload tool, the MCP server requests an upload from Cloudup. Cloudup responds with an [x402](https://x402.org) payment challenge. mpp-remote builds an [EIP-3009](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3009) `transferWithAuthorization`; the signature comes from `paw` (Path A — Privy holds the key), a local viem signer reading the Keychain (Path B), or a local viem signer reading `CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` (Path C). mpp-remote retries the original request with an `X-PAYMENT` header carrying that signature; Cloudup settles the payment on-chain and returns the share URL. Total time: a few seconds.

You only need USDC — no ETH for gas. The server submits the meta-transaction on your behalf.

## Troubleshooting

- **`/mcp` doesn't list `cloudup` at all** — Most often a duplicate-suppression collision: an existing manually-configured MCP server (in `~/.claude.json` or via `claude mcp add`) has the same `command + args` as the plugin's, and Claude Code drops the plugin's silently. Run `claude mcp list` to find duplicates, then `claude mcp remove <name>`. See step 5.
- **`/mcp` shows `cloudup` as "Failed to connect"** — On Path A: `paw` isn't installed (`npm i -g @privy-io/agent-wallet-cli`), or the user isn't logged in (`paw login`), or `npx`/`paw` aren't on PATH for non-interactive shells (add their dir to `~/.zshenv`). On Path B: no key in Keychain (`scripts/cloudup-key.sh status` should say "Key stored"). On Path C: `CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` malformed. The wrapper exits with a specific error message in each case.
- **"connection timed out after 30000ms"** — The MCP server is reachable but the upstream Cloudup endpoint isn't. Your A8c SSH tunnel (`ssh -D 8080 …`) isn't up on `localhost:8080`. Bring it back up — see the staging-endpoint section below.
- **"Spending cap exceeded"** — A single upload would exceed `CLOUDUP_MAX_USD`. Raise it (with care) or use a smaller file.
- **"Insufficient balance"** — Fund the wallet address with more testnet USDC on Base Sepolia (`paw fund` or a faucet).

## Reaching the staging endpoint (A8c-only for now)

The current default endpoint (`api.stage-cloudup.com`) is IP-restricted to the Automattic network. To reach it from a laptop, set `CLOUDUP_PROXY` in your shell environment **before** starting Claude Code (the wrapper reads it at MCP launch):

```
export CLOUDUP_PROXY=socks5h://127.0.0.1:8080
```

That's the conventional A8c SOCKS5 forwarder (`ssh -D 8080 <a8c-bastion>`). Keep the SSH tunnel up and the plugin will route upstream calls through it.

Use `socks5h://` rather than `socks5://` so DNS resolution happens server-side — internal cloudup hostnames may not be resolvable from your machine.

`CLOUDUP_PROXY` is **opt-in**. External users (or A8c users hitting a public endpoint when one exists) leave it unset and traffic goes direct.

## Caveats

External developers can install the plugin but will not be able to reach the server until a public/prod endpoint is available. Prod endpoint and a `/cloudup-balance` command are planned for v0.3.

## Version

`0.5.0` — Adds Path D (Bring your own key) for importing an existing private key into the macOS Keychain via a secure-paste flow:

- **`cloudup-key.sh set` with no argument** now delegates to the macOS Keychain helper's interactive `-w` prompt — the key never enters argv, shell history, or the Claude transcript. Refuses to run without a TTY, so accidental invocation from Claude's bash tool fails safely.
- **`/cloudup-setup` gains a "Bring your own key" branch** that walks the user through running `cloudup-key.sh set` in a separate terminal and verifying the import.
- The existing `cloudup-key.sh set 0x...` (argv form) is preserved for programmatic callers; it's documented as inappropriate for interactive paste.
- No wrapper changes — Path D keys land in the same Keychain slot as Path B, so signer precedence and runtime behavior are unchanged.

`0.4.0` — Security and extensibility cleanup on top of 0.3.0's three signer paths:

- **`viem` is pinned** to a specific version in `scripts/cloudup-key.sh` (previously `latest`), so a malicious upstream release cannot ride along into the process that handles the private key.
- **The private key is passed to `node -e` via an env var**, not as an argv string, so it no longer appears in `ps` listings.
- **`cloudup-key.sh show` is gone** — printing a raw private key from a CLI made it too easy to leak into shell history, scrollback, or a Claude Code transcript. Use `security find-generic-password -s cloudup -a wallet -w` directly if you really need it.
- **The SOCKS proxy is opt-in** via `CLOUDUP_PROXY` (previously hardcoded to `socks5h://127.0.0.1:8080`). External users can now actually hit a public endpoint when one exists; A8c users set the env var. **Breaking change for existing A8c users — see "Reaching the staging endpoint."**
- **The upload skill has a stronger sensitive-content gate** — agents must describe the image and confirm before paying, with explicit carve-outs only for agent-captured public-URL screenshots and user-named files.

`0.3.0` — Three signer paths, picked at MCP launch in this precedence order:
**Path C** (`CLOUDUP_WALLET_KEY` env var, CI / headless) → **Path B** (macOS Keychain, locally-generated key, managed by `scripts/cloudup-key.sh`) → **Path A** (Privy agent-wallet CLI, browser login). `/cloudup-setup` is now a chooser between A and B; C is documented in the README as the build-agent path. Path B is the v0.1 Keychain helper restored — it was dropped in 0.2.0 when Privy became the only laptop path, and is back so users who don't want third-party custody have a managed-on-machine option.
